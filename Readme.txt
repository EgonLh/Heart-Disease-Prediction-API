🚗 ML Model Monitoring System — Full Breakdown
🧱 Step 1: Build a Baseline ML Model
Goal: Train a simple ML model and prepare training data for future comparisons.

Tasks:
Choose a dataset (e.g., Credit Card Fraud, Churn, or Heart Disease)

Train a classifier (RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, etc.)

Split data into train/test

Save:

train.csv, test.csv

model.pkl

metrics.json

params.yaml (hyperparameters)

Tools:
scikit-learn, pandas, joblib

Track with DVC:

bash
Copy
Edit
dvc add data/train.csv
dvc add models/model.pkl
git commit -am "Add training data and model"
✅ This gives you versioned data and a reproducible training baseline.

⚙️ Step 2: Serve the Model with FastAPI
Goal: Wrap your model in a real-time prediction API.

Tasks:
Create a main.py using FastAPI:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.post("/predict")
def predict(data: DataInput):
    pred = model.predict(data)
    log_input_output(data, pred)
    return {"prediction": pred.tolist()}
Save all predictions + input data to logs/requests.csv

Tools:
FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic

✅ Now you can interact with your model in real time and start logging requests.

📈 Step 3: Log Predictions and Inputs
Goal: Store real-time data so you can monitor model behavior.

Tasks:
Log every API request: timestamp, features, prediction

Store in logs/requests.csv

Sample row:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
timestamp,age,income,class,prediction
2025-06-01T10:00,29,35000,,0
✅ This gives you a rolling dataset of live data for drift detection.

🧠 Step 4: Detect Data Drift with Evidently
Goal: Compare live data to training data and detect drift.

Tasks:
Install and use Evidently:

bash
Copy
Edit
evidently report \
  --reference data/train.csv \
  --current logs/requests.csv \
  --report evidently/data_drift_report.html
Schedule it to run hourly or daily (via cron or Python script)

Optional:
Export JSON stats for Prometheus:

bash
Copy
Edit
evidently json-report ... > drift_metrics.json
✅ Evidently gives clear visual and metric-based drift reports. Super useful.

📊 Step 5: Monitor Metrics in Prometheus + Grafana
Goal: View metrics and alerts for performance degradation and drift.

Tasks:
Create a Python Prometheus metrics endpoint:

python
Copy
Edit
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Gauge
drift_metric = Gauge("data_drift_score", "Data Drift Score")
drift_metric.set(0.2)
Connect this endpoint to Prometheus

Build a dashboard in Grafana showing:

Prediction confidence

Drift score

Model accuracy (if feedback is available)

Number of predictions over time

✅ You now have real-time visibility into your ML model’s health.

🔄 Step 6: Automate Monitoring with DVC Pipelines
Goal: Make the drift check reproducible and pipeline-ified.

Tasks:
Add a DVC stage:

bash
Copy
Edit
dvc stage add -n check_drift \
  -d logs/requests.csv -d data/train.csv \
  -o reports/drift.html \
  python src/check_drift.py
Track metrics and drift reports

✅ Now you can run dvc repro to rebuild your entire drift analysis.

📦 Step 7: Containerize with Docker
Goal: Package your entire app (FastAPI + monitoring) in Docker.

Dockerfile:
dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
✅ Now your monitoring service can be deployed anywhere — local or cloud.

🛠️ Step 8: Setup CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Goal: Auto-retrain and redeploy your model when data changes.

.github/workflows/mlops.yml
yaml
Copy
Edit
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - data/**
jobs:
  retrain:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install deps
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run pipeline
        run: dvc repro && dvc push
✅ This gives you a production-ready feedback loop.

📘 Step 9: Document & Visualize
Goal: Make your project easy to understand and replicate.

In README.md:
🧩 Architecture diagram (ML pipeline + monitoring stack)

🧪 How to test

🐳 How to run with Docker

🔧 How drift detection works

📊 Screenshots of Grafana dashboard

✅ Clean docs = professional vibes

🚀 Step 10: Publish & Brag A Little
Do:
Publish to GitHub

Add a LinkedIn post: “Built a real-time ML monitoring system with FastAPI, Evidently, and Prometheus.”

Share metrics and screenshots

Bonus: record a 2-min demo video

✅ This project is a conversation starter in job interviews and makes you look production-savvy.

💡 Want a quick starter template?
I can help you scaffold:

main.py for FastAPI

check_drift.py with Evidently

Dockerfile

dvc.yaml pipeline

README.md template

prometheus.yml + grafana.json dashboard file

Just say: "let’s scaffold it" and I’ll drop a full starter kit for you 🔨

Or would you like another project idea with a focus on LLM pipelines, batch data workflows, or real-time feature stores next?
